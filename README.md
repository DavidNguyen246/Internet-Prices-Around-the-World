## Purpose: 
 The main goal of this project is to perform the ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load) and document our steps taken in the process. The steps includes documenting the datasets used and their sources, types of data wragnling perfomed like cleaning, joining, filtering and aggregating. Also, the schemata used in the final production database.  The data for the extraction process can come from many different sources such as csv files, json files, html files, sql databases or spreadsheets. In this project , we've used 3 different csv files for extraction. We have jupyter notebook to transform the data. The transformation process includes data cleaning, selecting, joining , filtering and aggregating the data that we've used. For loading the data , we've used PostgreSql.
